# 1d-platformer-engine-console
It's first-person 1D game-platformer, where you play for 2D platformer character.

There are two solutions:
* 1DPlatformerEngineConsoleSln - Main solution. C#. It's have executable project Game, where setting level objects and setting other things. Game uses OneEngine like a framework, sending it info about level objects etc. In OneEngine happening most of development hell.
* MapOneReaderExclusive(MORE) - side app. Python. Get a png picture, read it and at the end produce, written in the code, info about level objects.
