# 1d-platformer-engine-console
It's first-person 1D game-platformer, where you play for 2D platformer character.

There are two solutions:
* 1DPlatformerEngineConsoleSln - Main solution. C#. It's have executable project Game, where setting level objects and setting other things. Game uses OneEngine like a framework, sending it info about level objects etc. In OneEngine happening most of development hell.
* MapOneReaderExclusive(MORE) - side app. Python. Get a png picture, read it and at the end produce, written in the code, info about level objects.

You can download game demonstration video:

You got... nothing? So, it's okay, even developers of this can't understand it to end. But it's main mission of it itself, 1D platformer must be percepted with ever upgrade easier and easier... So, let's move on!
