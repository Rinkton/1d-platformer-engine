First off you needa to create map itself in png format:

![Example map](mapOneReaderExclusive/map.png)

In left-upper corner you need along X axis in order colors in your map of void, block, player(In player case need to consider player width and height. You indicate by this point only left-upper corner of player).

So, now you may dive into creating level itself!

After that, you need to name that image by "map.png" and put it in directory with mapOneReaderExclusive.py, then run this file. (You need have Python on your machine)

Then look in "result.txt" in same directory, copy this and paste it 1d-platformer-engine-console/1DPlatformerEngineConsoleSln/Game/Program.cs inside firstObjs variable.

Run it and have fun.
